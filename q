Hello Oliver,
Appreciate the effort, Let us schedule sometime this week to discuss on this. I wanted to understand the following as next steps.

•	Potential architecture
•	How does this helps monica/tudor’s team? (As some of the examples you mentioned would help someone who maintains the data pipelines but not the data science team)
•	How would this be any different than what gemini integration does with the services?

Can you take a first stab on answering these and setup sometime by this week to discuss on next steps?
