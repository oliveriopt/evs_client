I completed the full lookup-table validation pipeline. The DAG now detects lookup candidates, verifies whether their PKs exist in lookup_table_relationships, writes the enriched results into BigQuery, and emits structured log events (LOOKUP_CANDIDATES_MISSING_DATA) whenever a mapping is missing.

A log-based alert policy is now active in Cloud Monitoring, so any missing or inconsistent lookup relations trigger an automated alert.

Next step: I want to unify lookup-table detection with the population of the lookup_table_relationships table, so both identification and relationship mapping become a single consistent process.
